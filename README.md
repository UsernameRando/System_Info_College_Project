# System Information

## Project Proposal

<br/>

I'm choising Project Zomboid because It's the game that got me into coding via it's modding community
I will be covering the injury process of the game
The user story is : <br/>

You first get attacked and depending on different factors, you will get an specific injury.
The injury will also provide different status effect
Then, depending on how you treat that injury you can get infected both bacterially or with the virus.
If you healed the injury it will go away, or stay until you die.

<br/>

Here we can see the full process from where the player get's injured to, the different ways that situation can turn out into depending on other factors <br/>
This is a basic overview of the way this system works.

<br/>

## Class diagram

<br/>

Here we can see the three classes necessary for this to work, It contains all the different injuries, and health item, and the player class <br/> 
with all of their prorieties. And all the correlations between the different classes  

<br/>

## Sequence Diagram

<br/>

Here with the sequence Diagram we go over all the interactions between the front and back end. such as When to update the UI, when the injury can get removed <br/>
The necessary steps in between and so on. This sequence diagram however mostly focus on the health panel functionality.
